# Markov-Chain-Twitter-Chatbot
 
This is a Markov chain bot that allows the user to chat with a celebrity. The user would enter any existing twitter handle of a celebrity, along with a message, and they would receive an intelligent response back, which would be a random tweet pulled from the Twitter API.
